# DeepEpitif

DeepEpitif is a universial deep learning framework based on TensorFlow/Keras, 
which is designed to make deep learning studies of epigenetic datasets easy. 

It consists of many useful helper functions/classes/modules implemented in python, which cover all essential steps for deep learning studies, including data preparation and inputting for deep learning models,  model trainning/validation/testing and model interepration. With these convenient functions, the users can focus on model itself without spending time to build the platform to let model run.
